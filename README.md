# FletClick üñ±Ô∏èüêç

Welcome to FletClick, an open-source automatic clicking tool built with Python and the fantastic Flet framework. 
This is my educational pet project aimed at learning and showcasing the capabilities of Flet while providing a useful application for streamlining your workflow.
Additionally, this project aimed to enhance my skills in application design, implement design patterns such as Singleton and Observer with a custom event-driven mechanism, and explore multiprocessing capabilities.
